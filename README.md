# Thesis_Project

This project resulted in the thesis work "Building Damage Assessment from natural disasters using Satellite Images: a Deep Learning approach tested on the xBD dataset". The purpose of the work is to find the best Convolutional Network architecture for the purpose of Building Damage Assessment using Satellite Images and to find analytic patterns that determine if the buildings of a particular natural disaster are easier or harder to classify.
